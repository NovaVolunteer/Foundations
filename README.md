###  Course Description:

The purpose of this course is to provide students with an understanding of data science in practice with a focus on empirical decision making using a contemporary data science lifecycle approach. In doing so, the course is separated into three high-level sections covering two semesters. The first semester focuses on understanding the field of data science and skills needed to have a successful career as a data scientist. This is followed by content centered on creating and using pipelines for data acquisition, wrangling, and visualization. The second semester is designed to preparing students to communicate data-driven outcomes through presentations, research papers and working through case studies to better understand typical challenges faced in the field.

### Learning Outcomes:
## Part I
 - Understanding of the data science lifecycle
 - How to plan and execute data driven projects as a team
 - How to gather and clean data using Python
 - The creation and utilization of data science pipelines
 - Creation of simple web-based interactive visualizations

#### Projects and Presentations 
There will be two presentations designed to demonstrate your understanding of the practices being discussed as applied to your capstone projects. 

#### In-Class Exercises:
These assessments will be used to check learning and give feedback on areas for improvement. Reading prior to class, class attendance, and participation in activities are essential for success on this part of the course.
 
#### Labs: 
Details on requirements will be given during class periods. Most assignments will be due the next class (NC) period and can be submitted via colab. We will work to provide feedback in the next class session. 

#### Quizzes: 
There will be at least two quizzes in either take home or in-class form. 

#### Grading Scale:
 - 93-100 A
 - 90-92 A- 
 - 87-89 B+
 - 83-86 B 
 - 80-82 B- 
 - 77-79 C+ 
 - 73-76 C 
 - 70-72 C- 
 - <70 F
 
### Estimated time requirements for the course
The course meets twice a week for roughly 1 hour and half. It's likely for every hour of class time two hours of work outside of the classroom at minimum will be necessary for successful completion of the course requirements. This bringd the total curricular related hours up to roughly 9 hours per week.
