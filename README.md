###  Course Description:

The purpose of this course is to provide students with an understanding of data science in practice with a focus on empirical decision making using a contemporary data science lifecycle approach. In doing so, the course is separated into three high level sections covering two semesters. The first semester focuses on understanding the field of data science and skills needed to have a successful career as a data scientist. This is followed by content centered on creating and using pipelines for data aquisition, wraggling and visualization.  The second semester is designed to preparing students to communicate data driven outcomes through presentations, research papers and working through  case studies to better understand typical challenges faced in the field.  

### Learning Outcomes:
## Part I
 - Understanding of field of data science at large and how to approach data driven approaches
 - The creation and utilization of data science pipelines
 

### Tentative Schedule Part I:
This is a tentative schedule and is subject to change. Please check here regularly for updates.

These assessments will be used to check learning and give feedback on areas for improvement. Reading prior to class, class attendance, and participation in activities are essential for success on this part of the course.
 
#### Labs: 
Details on requirements will be given during class periods. Most assignments will be due the next class (NC) period and can be submitted via colab. We will work to provide feedback in the next class session. 

#### Quizzes: 
There will be at least two quizzes in either take home or in-class form. 

#### Grading Scale:
 - 93-100 A
 - 90-92 A- 
 - 87-89 B+

### Estimated time requirements for the course
The course meets twice a week for roughly 1 hour and half. It's likely for every hour of class time two hours of work outside of the classroom at minimum will be necessary for successful completion of the course requirements. This bringd the total curricular related hours up to roughly 9 hours per week.
